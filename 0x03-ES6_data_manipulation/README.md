# ðŸš€ JavaScript ES6 Data Manipulation ðŸš€

Welcome to the ES6 Data Manipulation project! Here, we'll explore various ES6 features like map, filter, reduce, and work with data structures such as Set, Map, and WeakMap.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to enhance your understanding of ES6 data manipulation techniques. You'll work through tasks ranging from basic array operations to handling typed arrays and advanced data structures.

### Key Features

- Utilize map, filter, and reduce on arrays
- Work with typed arrays
- Explore the Set, Map, and WeakMap data structures

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, make sure you have Node.js (version 12.11.x) installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

## Tasks Overview

### Task 0: Basic List of Objects

- Create a function to return a list of students with specific attributes.

### Taks 1: More Mapping

- Extract student ids from a list of objects using the map function.

### Task 2: Filtering

- Filter students based on their location.

### Task 4: Reduction

- Calculate the sum of student ids using the reduce function.

### Task 5:  Combination

- Update student grades based on city and provided grades.

### Task 6: Typed Arrays

- Manipulate typed arrays to insert values at specific positions.

### Task 7: Set Data Structure

- Convert an array to a Set data structure.

### Task 8: More Set Data Structure

- Check if all elements of an array exist in a Set.

### Task 9: Cleaning Set

- Clean a Set by filtering values based on a specific string prefix.

### Task 10: Map Data Structure

- Create a grocery list using the Map data structure.

### Task 11: More Map Data Structure

- Update quantities of unique items in the grocery list.

### Task 12: Weak Link Data Structure (Advanced)

- Track API query counts using the WeakMap data structure.
