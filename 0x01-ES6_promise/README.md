# ES6 Promises Project

This project focuses on mastering the concepts of ES6 Promises in JavaScript. It covers various tasks designed to deepen your understanding and proficiency in handling promises.

## Tasks

### 0. Keep every promise you make and only make promises you can keep
- Return a Promise using the given prototype function `getResponseFromAPI()`.

### 1. Don't make a promise...if you know you can't keep it
- Implement `getFullResponseFromAPI(success)` to return a promise based on the provided conditions.

### 2. Catch me if you can!
- Implement `handleResponseFromAPI(promise)` to append handlers to a given promise.

### 3. Handle multiple successful promises
- Implement `handleProfileSignup()` to handle multiple promises and log results or errors.

### 4. Simple promise
- Implement `signUpUser(firstName, lastName)` to return a resolved promise with provided data.

### 5. Reject the promises
- Write and export a function `uploadPhoto(filename)` that returns a Promise rejecting with an error.

### 6. Handle multiple promises
- Implement `handleProfileSignup(firstName, lastName, fileName)` to handle multiple promises and return an array of results.

### 7. Load balancer
- Implement `loadBalancer(chinaDownload, USDownload)` to return the value of the fastest resolved promise.

### 8. Throw error / try catch
- Implement `divideFunction(numerator, denominator)` to handle division and throw an error if denominator is 0.

### 9. Throw an error
- Implement `guardrail(mathFunction)` to handle errors and return an array of results or error messages.

### 10. Await / Async
- Write an async function `asyncUploadUser()` to call async functions and return an object with the results.
